Bugfix from David Carr to correct row and col reversal in BGA omitballs
Several improvements sent to me by Peter Baxendale, with some modification
by DLH: Square pin 1 on all through hole, optional inside silkscreen on
SO parts with diagonal corner for pin 1, to enable use silkstyle = "inside",
disabled by default or use silkstyle = "none"

Added patch by David Carr to add silkstyle="corners" option on qfp
set silkboxwidth and silkboxheigh if using this style

Added refdesx and refdesy attributes which allow the reference designator to be positioned as desired
Previously the reference designator was located at the origin. This is still the default.

allow exposed pads on SO parts
added "rect" option

It sets the height, and is only available in so at this time.

Changed fundamental units from centimils to nanometers
Changed flags from integers to strings (as per newer format)
Changed a few hard coded distances from values such as
1000, 4000 or 3940 (centimils) to 1000000nm.  These hard
coded distances are still ugly, but now at least they are
metric ugly instead of imperial ugly

Embed the filename in the file, helps when inspecting the resulting PCB layout file

Changed <options> to be a python list rather than a string in generators,
__init__, and examples.  Initially, I noticed that geda.py was ignoring my
"hole" option because flags were simply set based on the presence or absence
of "cir" or "round", thus tossing any other options.  To search through and
remove "cir" or "round" from the options string seemed unpythonic, so I
switched everything over to using a list instead.  Unfortunately, this will
break backwards compatibiilty with scripts that assume options is a string--if
desired, I can write some type checking to maintain backwards compatibility.
